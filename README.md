## Setup
How python versions differ, specifically between 2.7 and >3.
Quick mention of tools to use with python, such as pip and editors. Debugging functionality of PyCharm.
Running python from terminal.
Venv?

## Language background
Default implemnetation called CPython. This is what you will download. Compiled Python code into bytecode. Other implementation which won't be covered.

Python is a object oriented programming language. Dynamically and a strong typed language. EVERYTHING in python is an object.
(example in the future)
Interpreter does not know the type of a variable before runtime. Variables can change type during runtime.
High level programming lanuguage, no memory handling, drawback is performance.

## Basic syntax
### Functions
- Indentations
- No return statement
- Pass by value or reference
- Multiple arguments

### Print:
- write to stdout
- string formatting
- New string formatting with python 3.6+, use "f" prefix. Works with strings, integers, floats.

### Strings:
- Iterable
- Indexing, specifically -1
- `in`
 Comparison:
 - `==` and `is`. `is` compares object references. `==` compares equality. Generally use `==`

## Syntax
Function and class syntax. private, protected attributes.
Mypy (optional static tyiping). 

## Project content

- Lists (not bounded by type)
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets

Imports

Conditionals, loops:

- if (ternary operator)

Classes:
